main.ipynb: Holds all of my helper functions (computeAffine, morph). Shows my face being warped to George Clooney's face.
Also shows the average face of the females in the Danes dataset and my face warped to it/vice versa.

Note: I had to remove the Danes dataset from my submission because there were too many files.
